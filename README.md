# Hand Gesture Volume Control

Control your computer's audio volume with hand gestures using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project allows us to control your computer's audio volume by using hand gestures captured by our webcam. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and the pycaw library to control the audio volume.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- pycaw

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pycaw
```
